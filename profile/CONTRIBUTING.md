# CONTRIBUTING

All MER repositories follow the same contribution pattern:

1. Create a fork of the original repository and push your changes there.
2. Unless your contribution targets an existing issue, create an issue in the original repository describing your changes.
3. Create a pull-request targeting main repository `dev` branch.
