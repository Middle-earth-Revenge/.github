# Welcome!

Middle-earth Revenge (MER) is The One Place for all The Lord of the Rings Online reverse-engineering.

## What is this place?

Please read our [FAQ](FAQ.md).

## Got it. So what's there?

Some repos contain original prototyping code, including [Revenge Server](https://github.com/Middle-earth-Revenge/RevengeServer).

A few repos are mirrors and/or forks of any code that might be relevant to our endeavour, for example [OneLauncher](https://github.com/Middle-earth-Revenge/OneLauncher).

A lot of repos are archived mirrors of abandoned code from earlier attempts at researching LotRO networking: [lotro-analyzer](https://github.com/Middle-earth-Revenge/lotro-analyzer) and others.

Also, we have a [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AvFccrT6YPVUgpsxwYO9kj-XGX1jPA) folder for larger files, including but not limited to legacy LotRO clients.
